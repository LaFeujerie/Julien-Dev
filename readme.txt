This is a small php script which can be used to create twitter bots. I’ve used two files (twitteroauth.php and OAuth.php) of Abraham’s twitteroauth project to create this app. It works on OAuth, so no need to enter your twitter password.

Instruction to use this script can be found here - http://www.prasannasp.net/how-to-create-a-twitter-bot/
